	<p>And I'm his friend Jesus. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>
	<h2>Spanish Fry</h2>
	<p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Switzerland is small and neutral!

	<li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li>

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Look, last night was a mistake.</p>

	<h5>That Darn Katz!</h5>
	<p>Hello Morbo, how's the family? Of all the friends I've had&hellip; you're the first. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
